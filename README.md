# Mat_Transpose
Implementation of matrix transpose in C — reads elements from the user, stores them in a 2D array, and displays the transposed matrix.
📖 Overview
This project demonstrates a simple C program that finds the transpose of a matrix.
The program takes user input for the number of rows, columns, and elements of a matrix, then prints the transposed version by interchanging rows and columns.
⚙️ Features
Takes matrix input dynamically from the user.
Uses nested loops to perform the transpose operation.
Works for any rectangular or square matrix.
Simple and beginner-friendly logic in C.
💻 Code Logic
Input the number of rows and columns.
Store elements in a 2D array.
Print the original matrix.
Use loops to swap rows and columns (arr[i][j] → arr[j][i]).
Display the transposed matrix.
